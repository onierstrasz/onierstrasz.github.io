# Abstract

Mastering a PhD can feel at times like tangling with a wild beast. It takes creativity, discipline, and care to bring it safely home. We will discuss some of the most common difficulties PhD students may encountering whether they are just starting their PhD work, or or well along the way to completing it. In particular, we will cover tips and tricks useful for planning PhD research, writing about it, and presenting it, as well for maintaining focus along the way to completion of the PhD.
