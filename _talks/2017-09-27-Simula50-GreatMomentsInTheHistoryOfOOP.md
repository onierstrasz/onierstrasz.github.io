Invited talk at [Simula 50 Years](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/personer/vit/dag/simula67/50years/): “Great Moments in the History of OOP” (50 years anniversary of Simula, the first object-oriented programming language — Oslo, Norway, Sept. 27, 2017)

# Abstract

Object-Oriented Programming has matured over the years from being an exotic (and oft-derided) programming paradigm to an established, successful (and oft-derided) cornerstone of modern software development. This talk will present a very personal tour of some of the milestones in the history of OOP, from its very beginnings to the present day.
