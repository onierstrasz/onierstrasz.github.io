Presentation at [Smalltalk Meetup Zurich](https://zurich.smalltalk.world) (Zurich, April 26, 2024) — “Example-Driven Development”

## Abstract

Example-Driven Development is superficially like Test-Driven Development, where you drive development by constructing tests methods that return example objects.
It sounds simple, but it actually changes the development process in several fundamental ways.

In this talk we will introduce the concept of example methods as an alternative to traditional unit tests. We will show how examples not only enable hierarchies of tests that reduce code duplication and cascading failures, but they can lead to an exploratory approach to TDD.
