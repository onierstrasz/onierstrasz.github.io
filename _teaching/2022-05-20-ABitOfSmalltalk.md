This guest lecture for the Bachelors course, [Programming 2 (introduction to object-oriented design)](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/teaching/current/p2/) taught by [Timo Kehrer](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/people/timo/), was given on May 20, 2022 at the University of Bern, and repeated on May 12, 2023 and May 9, 2024.
The lecture consists of a live demo of the Smalltalk programming language in the [Glamorous Toolkit environment](https://gtoolkit.com).
The lecture relies on a demo of the Ludo game which was the subject of students group work during the course. During the lecture we see two alternative implementations of the game and how their internal implementation is visualized and documented in the environment.

The lecture was given as a live demo. To explore the live “slides”, you can run the demo by [downloading Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/download/) and evaluating the following code in a playground:
