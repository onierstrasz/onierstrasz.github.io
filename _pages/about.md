# About me

I am Professor emeritus of Computer Science at the [University of Bern](http://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), where I founded the [Software Composition Group](https://scg.unibe.ch) in 1994.
I retired from the University at the end of 2021, and am currently working at [feenk.com](https://feenk.com/about/).
I am co-author of over 300 [publications](/publications) and co-author of the open-source books *[Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns](https://scg.unibe.ch/assets/download/oorp/)* and *[Pharo by Example](http://books.pharo.org)*.
