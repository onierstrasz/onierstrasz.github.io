<p>From 1994 to 2021 I taught numerous courses in the areas of programming and software engineering at the University of Bern.
I also supervised or co-supervised 
<a href="https://scg.unibe.ch/assets/scgbib/?query=scg-phd&filter=Year">40 PhD theses</a>, 
<a href="https://scg.unibe.ch/assets/scgbib/?query=scg-msc&filter=Year">88 MSc theses</a> and 
153 <a href="https://scg.unibe.ch/assets/scgbib/?query=scg-bp&filter=Year">Bachelors</a> and <a href="https://scg.unibe.ch/assets/scgbib/?query=scg-ip&filter=Year">undergraduate</a> project theses.

<p>Please see the <a href="https://scg.unibe.ch/teaching">SCG Teaching</a> page for a list of courses and course evaluations.
You can also find archives there of PDFs of the slides.
Much of the course material is available on GitHub under Creative Commons licenses.
You will find links to the repos on the same page.</p>

<h1>Guest lectures</h1>

<p>Since then I have continued to give occasional guest lectures on topics close to my work interests.</p>
