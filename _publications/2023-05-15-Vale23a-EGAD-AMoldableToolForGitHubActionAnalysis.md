# Abstract

GitHub Actions (GA) enjoy increasing popularity in many software
development projects as a means to automate repetitive software
engineering tasks by enabling programmable event-driven workflows.
Researchers typically analyze GA at the raw data level using batch
tools to mine and analyze actions, jobs, and steps within GA
workflows. Although this approach is widely applicable, it ignores
the specific context of the GA workflow domain. Consequently,
researchers do not reason directly about the domain abstractions. We
present our preliminary steps in building EGAD (Explorable GitHub
Action Domain Model), a moldable domain-specific tool to depict and
analyze detailed GA workflow data. EGAD consists of an explorable
domain model of GA workflows augmented with custom, domain-specific
views, and live narratives. We illustrate EGAD in action using it
to explore “sticky commits” in GitHub repositories.
