# Abstract

Moldable development supports decision-making by
making software systems explainable. This is done by making it
cheap to add numerous custom tools to your software, turning it
into a live, explorable domain model. Based on several years of
experience of applying moldable development to both open-source and
industrial systems, we have identified several mutually supporting
patterns to explain how moldable development works in practice.
This paper targets (i) readers curious to learn about moldable
development, (ii) current users of the \emph{Glamorous Toolkit}
moldable IDE wanting to learn best practices, and (iii) developers
interested in applying moldable development using other platforms
and technology.
